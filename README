This is a prototype for doing server side rendering in Javascript (using trimpath, but it 
would be easy to use anything else.

This is actually a fork of swiss army bundle, although I've removed all the swissarmy source,
but it was an easy project to spring board off of.

There are really only 2 source files, one which is the java servlet, and the other which is the
javascript.  Plus a couple files which are trimpath templates.

Build Instructions:
1. mvn clean install -Predeploy
2. Mount /dev with a FS Resource as you normally would when doing UX development.
3. cp -R ./rhino /whereever/your/3akai-ux/stuff/is/dev/  # so it needs to be /dev/rhino

Try out the following:
http://localhost:8080/system/swissrender?t=/dev/simple
http://localhost:8080/system/swissrender?t=/dev/basicuser
http://localhost:8080/system/swissrender?t=/me
